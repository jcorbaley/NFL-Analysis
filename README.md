# NFL-Analysis

Every year there are 19 weeks where all day on Sunday, Monday night, and Thursday night 32 teams will battle to make it to the end of the year. This is the National Football League (NFL). Each of those weeks two teams play each other to see who can score more points. There is an offense and a defense on each team. The offense tries to move the football down the 100-yard field to score a touchdown worth 6 points. They have 4 downs, or tries, every 10 yards before they must give it to the other team. To do this they use a series of combinations of pass and run plays. While the offense attempts this the defense does their best to stop them. At the end of the game whoever has more points wins.

No two games are the same and the performance of a team can vary week to week. One week a team can look like they are unbeatable, the next they could look like they have blindfolds on and canâ€™t score at all. Therefore, many people tune into their televisions every week to watch their favorite team play. This makes the NFL a multi-billion-dollar business. If you have ever been to Las Vegas, Nevada or you happen to live in a state where sports betting is legal, then you know that you can place a wager on a game. Have you ever wondered what some of the wagers are? I am going to dive into all the past data on the over/under of the game to see if there are any relationships out there.
